# odin-recipes

This has been a very fun experience building my first project, although it is quite simple, it still taught me quite of few skills that were previously taught me that are now held more firmly within my head

[Live Demo](https://loyalistxx.github.io/odin-recipes/)

for example, Googling, It seems that every question and problem i have have been asked and solved by somebody else on the internet, especially when you consider the time factor, i've found answers for problems i've had that were posted in the early 2010s, maybe as my problems get more and more complex i'll find some earlier, but it probably be the opposite

also i'm learning how to ask questions to problems i can't find answers to easily, thanks to Asarta and kev for helping me figure out how relative paths work exactly

can't wait to try more projects, thanks odin
